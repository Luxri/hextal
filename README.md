# hextal
(For the last annoying assignment in the programing 1 class.)
The code should be able to read a string that the user have written. 
The code should then look for '0x', this will mean a hexadecimal number exists in the string. 
The code will then look for the letters 0 and a-f. 
If the code finds any letter other than 0 or a-f then it will conclude that the hexadecimal number is finished. 
The code will translate the letters to numbers with the base of ten. 
The code will then add the different numbers together to get a result. (Like this 0x2a = 2*16^1+10*16^0 = 32+10 = 42)
The code will also make sure that 0x comes before any a-f letter before it starts counting any hexadecimal numbers.
